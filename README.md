# How to Re-install macOS High Sierra and the PHP Development Environment.
This document is a guideline for re-installing macOS High Sierra and the PHP
development environment on my MacBook Pro, so it contains some steps that are
specific for my own environment, such as the instructions for backing up and
restoring files. 

However, these steps are irrelevant and can be safely ignored, and the rest of
this document is still very useful for people who have troubles with installing
macOS High Sierra (such as failed to update firmware or to download the full
installer, and etc) or compiling PHP from source (such as the missing symbols
issue).
